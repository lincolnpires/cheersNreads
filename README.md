## Overview
CheersAndReads is an ASP.NET project developed for the DeveloperWeek Hackathon (2024). The project is a book club application that allows users to schedule meetings, authenticate, and interact with various book-related features.

## Technology Stack
The primary technology used in this project is ASP.NET. The project structure is feature-based using Razor Pages and Bootstrap.

- appsettings.json: This file contains configuration settings for the application.
- wwwroot/: This directory contains static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- assets/: This directory is used to store assets used by the application.
